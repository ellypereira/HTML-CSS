        <h1>Aurora</h1>
       
        <p>And I was running far away
            Would I run off the world someday?
            Nobody knows, nobody knows
            I was dancing in the rain
            I felt alive and I can't complain
            But now take me home
            Take me home where I belong
            I can't take it anymore</p>
        <p>I was painting a picture
            The picture was a painting of you
            And for a moment I thought you were here
            But then again, it wasn't true, down
            And all this time I have been lying
            Oh, lying in secret to myself
            I've been putting sorrow on the farthest place on my shelf
            And I was running far away
            Would I run off the world someday?â€¦
            </p>
        <h1>The Cranberries</h2>
        <p>It's the same old theme
            Since nineteen-sixteen
            In your head, in your head, they're still fighting
            With their tanks and their bombs
            And their bombs, and their guns
            In your head, in your head, they are dying</p>
        <p>In your head, in your head
            Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
            What's in your head, in your head
            Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie</p>
        <h1>Gorillaz</h2>
        <p>Up on melancholy hill
            There's a plastic tree
            Are you here with me?
            Just looking out on the day
            Of another dream</p>
        <p>Well you can't get what you want
            But you can get me
            So let's set out to sea
            'Cause you are my medicine
            When you're close to me
            When you're close to me</p>
